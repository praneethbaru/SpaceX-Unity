# SpaceX-Unity
A 3D game built using Unity Gaming Engine.

SpaceX is a second-person view 3D space themed collison evading game with time dependent  levels of difficulty. The motto of the player is to evade the space obstacles and survive for as long as possible. There are two modes in the game:
a)Survival mode
b)Normal modes

Survival mode: This mode is time constrained mode where the player has to pick the time extension pack where the player will get a boost of additional 2 minutes to play with increased difficulty.

Normal Mode: In this mode the player keeps playing until the space pod is collided thrice. We plan to implement this theme “Travel the Universe” where the player has to travel the planets of the solar system to complete the game and the scores will be calculated on the time taken to reach the end.
